- Hi, I’m Alexander of Macedon
- After conquering the world, I have turned my attention to coding.
- Since my generals, the Diadochi are long dead, I am looking for new collaborations on GitHub.
- I’m interested in game programming (2D, ASCII art games, 3D). I currently code in Lua using the Love2D library and in Luau using the Roblox game engine.
- Handles: Email: Alex.junk.extra@gmail.com, Discord: Idaspp
- Currently developing an sandbox version of the Roblox game "Isle".
